    "## 0.1. Approach\n",
    "1. An in-depth analysis of the data was conducted to identify any issues with the quality of the data.<u>(Please refer to sections 1/2/3)</u>\n",
    "2. Next, an automated algorithm based on pearson's correlation and ANOVA's f-score is used to filter out irrelevant or duplicated features <u>(Please refer to section 4)</u>\n",
    "3. The data is split in train/test while ensuring that all vectors for a specific receipt are in the same split. This is necessary as all features are based on information from both the receipt image and the transaction. <u>(Please refer to section 5.)</u>\n",
    "4. A tree-based boosting algorithm (XGBoost) is used as a classifier. This is a perfect algorithm for the current task, as it can work very well with ordinal data and has high performance of imbalanced datasets. <u>(Please refer to section 6.)</u>\n",
    "5. The hyperparameters of the model are then optimized using a randomized search across pre-defined search space. Due to time constraints this approach was selected instead of using hyperparameter optimizers like hyperopt, which rely on bayesian optimization to find the optimal set of hyperparameters. The hyperparameter tuning is done on the training data by utilizing a cross-validation approach due to limited number of \"positive\" events. <u>(Please refer to section 6.)</u>\n",
    "6. The final model is trained on the full training data and is evaluated on the test data <u>(Please refer to section 6.)</u>\n",
    "7. Finally all steps are incorporated within a train.py script available in the root\n",
    "8. Please note that the model doesn't return a list, but an array with the original order of the data input. It is not advised for a model to return output in order different from its input, so for this project I would approach the data architect to revise the specification and impelment the ordering outside of the model \n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.2. Results\n",
    "1. The discriminatory power of the model is very high with <u>Gini on both Train and Test higher than 93%</u>. This means that the model performs very well in ordering the matching vectors <u>(Please refer to section 7.)</u>\n",
    "2. Distribution of the final score looks good, with observed values across the full range between 0 and 1. This means that we don't have huge clumps of values in a single score, which could complicate the discrimination. In addition it shows that even without calibration the probability score can serve as an indication of the true probability.\n",
    "3. The Final success rate is reported using 4 metrics:\n",
    "- <b>\"User Success Rate\" = 61%</b> - This is the success rate of visualziing the correct transaction in the final app as experienced by the user\n",
    "- <b>\"Maximum Success Rate\" = 75%</b> - This is the maximum success rate given that for a large proportion of the data we don't have the correct transaction supplied and assuming that when we have same explanatory features for 2 transactions, one of which is the correct one, we will select the correct one by chance\n",
    "- <b>\"Normaized Success Rate\" = 81%</b> - This is the success rate of the model after accounting for the receipts with missing matched transactions\n",
    "- <b>\"Normaized For Missing and Duplicates Success Rate\" = 91%</b> - This is the cussess rate after account for the receipts with missing matched transactions and after excluding all receipts for which we have same features for both the matched transaction and an incorrect transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "All 4 above metrics are useful and they highlight the 2 main sources leading to lower model performance:\n",
    "- The quality of the data. It's impact can be seen by comparing the \"User Cussess Rate\" and the \"normalized For Missing and Duplicates Success Rate\"\n",
    "- Model specification and noise\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0.3. Below you can find a list of next steps to improve the model\n",
    "1. Contact the data supplier and discuss how to improve the current data extracts, as 26% of the supplied receipts don't have a matched transaction. <u>(Please refer to section 2.9)</u>\n",
    "2. Request higher granularity for some of the input features as for 22% of all receipts we have a matched transaction with exactly the same features as at least one another <u>(Please refer to section 2.9)</u>\n",
    "3. This means that in total 48% of the receipts can't be mapped consistently or at all, so it should be of highest priority to improve the quality of the data <u>(Please refer to section 2.9)</u>\n",
    "4. The hyperparameter tuning algorithm can be improved by utilizing package \"hyperopt\" (available in the pip index).\n",
    "5. We can introduce a threshold to exclude transaction with very low estiamted model confidence from the returned results. This is expected to improve the user experience.\n",
    "6. To do so, we should obtain a new independent dataset, apply the model on it, order it by predicted probability and see if below a certain threshold we don't see any matched transaction ids. This would speed up the process of validation for the app user.\n",
    "7. In addition we can increase the interpretability of the final score estimates by calibrating the resutls on the new independent dataset from the above point. For that we can use sklearn.calibration.CalibratedClassifierCV."
